## Phase 1: Lexical Analyzing
Preparing the right input for the lexer tool. Provide "tokens" to be passed to the next phase.

## Phase 2: Semantic Analyzing
Give the tokens to the semantic analyzer to be checked against the [given grammer](https://github.com/amirosein/Amh-Compiler/blob/master/Grammer.pdf).

## Phase 3: A Finite Deterministic Machine for LR0 Grammers
Implementation of a finite deterministic machine for LR0 grammers with Java. This code can accept different grammers and you can see the test cases that the code has been tested with.
